Things to do:
- Create State Manager and State interface.
- Probably can make the Handler static, look into making sure it works across different states. 
- Utilities can have some stuff moved out to a static config class, figure out if World can be combined in some way
- Create a Map class that is responsible for showing the map. Figure out where the entity manager fits into that.
- Figure out whether to do regular components or real ECS : http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013
