Things to do:
- Fix the stupid media player when you want to play a sfx several times very quickly.
- Implement TaskQueue - this can do things like play spell animations, move npcs, cutscenes, etc.
- World json (soon gson) file should probably be two dimensional (instead of one long string) - let's see what gson will let us do.
- Make the dialog box all purty.
- Save/Load the entire game as a file (current world, X/Y, etc.)
- Make a different Overworld map and inner map with a way to switch between the two.
- Have the Spell option in the BattleState open a sub-menu with spells.
- Complete/figure out full NPC pathing.
