Things to do:
- Utilities can have some stuff moved out to a static config class
- Figure out whether to do regular components or real ECS : http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013
- Make dialog move onto next line when it needs to (easy)
- Fix the stupid media player when you want to play a sfx several times very quickly.
- Implement TaskQueue - this can do things like play spell animations, move npcs, cutscenes, etc.
