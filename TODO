Things to do:
- Utilities can have some stuff moved out to a static config class
- Figure out whether to do regular components or real ECS : http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013
- Fix the stupid media player when you want to play a sfx several times very quickly.
- Implement TaskQueue - this can do things like play spell animations, move npcs, cutscenes, etc.


- Figure out NPC to DialogState relationship.
---- What this one will be is kind of like this: 
---- An NPC entity will have a component that says they can be talked to (talkable, or something)
---- This component will keep the ID of their line of dialog.
---- When you press the interact key in from of someone and they have the component, 
----     then you move to the dialog state with that ID as an argument (still haven't put in arguments)
---- Then rather than using testMessage in dialog state, the only thing that needs to change
---- is to look up the line of dialog using the ID.


- Figure out how to keep track of which direction the player is facing.
- Look into using GSON to make loading json files more efficient and less complicated.
